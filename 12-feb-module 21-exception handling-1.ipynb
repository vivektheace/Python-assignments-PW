    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is a runtime error that can be handled by the program to avoid crashing.\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the execution of a program. When Python encounters an error, it raises an exception. If the exception is not handled, the program will terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of exceptions include:\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: Raised when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list or tuple.\n",
    "KeyError: Raised when trying to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running. They occur when the code does not conform to the syntax rules of the Python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples include:\n",
    "Missing colons, parentheses, or indentation errors.\n",
    "Misspelled keywords or incorrect usage of operators.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Key Differences Between Exceptions and Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Timing of Detection:\n",
    "Exceptions: Detected at runtime when the program is executed.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Detected at compile-time (before the program runs) by the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Handling:\n",
    "Exceptions: Can be caught and handled using try and except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Must be fixed by correcting the code. They cannot be caught or handled because the program won't run until they are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Nature:\n",
    "Exceptions: Often due to unforeseen conditions like invalid user input, network issues, or file not found errors.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Due to incorrect code structure, such as missing colons, indentation issues, or misspelled keywords."
