    "A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently. They can be classified into different types based on their structure and use cases, such as relational, non-relational, distributed, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tStructure: SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. They use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data.\n",
    "\t2.\tQuery Language: They use SQL for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "\t3.\tScalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning they scale by increasing the power (CPU, RAM) of a single server.\n",
    "\t4.\tExamples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\t5.\tACID Compliance: SQL databases are generally ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, ensuring reliable transactions.\n",
    "\t6.\tUse Cases: Suitable for complex queries and transactions, such as banking systems, enterprise applications, and any situation where data integrity is critical.\n",
    "    \n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tStructure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs. They have a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "\t2.\tQuery Language: They use different query languages depending on the type of database (e.g., MongoDB uses a query language based on JavaScript, while Cassandra uses CQL).\n",
    "\t3.\tScalability: NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning they scale by adding more servers to the database.\n",
    "\t4.\tExamples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n",
    "\t5.\tACID Compliance: NoSQL databases may not fully support ACID transactions but often provide eventual consistency and other mechanisms like BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency).\n",
    "\t6.\tUse Cases: Suitable for large volumes of unstructured data, real-time web applications, big data analytics, and scenarios requiring flexible schema design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are ideal for structured data and complex transactions, while NoSQL databases are suited for unstructured data and scalability.  "

    "### Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a field (or a combination of fields) in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: Each value in a primary key column must be unique. This ensures that each record can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "- **Non-null**: Primary keys cannot contain NULL values. Every record must have a value for the primary key field(s).\n",
    "- **Immutable**: The values in a primary key should not change. Once assigned, they should remain constant for the lifetime of the record.\n",
    "- **Single or Composite**: A primary key can consist of a single field (simple primary key) or multiple fields (composite primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a field (or a combination of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. The foreign key is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in the two tables. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relationship**: Foreign keys establish a relationship between tables. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the parent table.\n",
    "- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys help maintain referential integrity by ensuring that a record in the child table corresponds to an existing record in the parent table.\n",
    "- **Can be Null**: Unlike primary keys, foreign keys can contain NULL values. A NULL foreign key indicates that the relationship is optional.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Foreign key constraints can be used to enforce rules about how data can be updated or deleted. For example, an ON DELETE CASCADE constraint will automatically delete all child records when the corresponding parent record is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Orders Table**:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table is the primary key, uniquely identifying each customer.\n",
    "- `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key, establishing a link between the `Orders` table and the `Customers` table. This foreign key indicates which customer placed each order."
